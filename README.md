## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I worked hard to make states synced to have a nice and dynamic page
The hardest part is passing everything to the exact component so that it doesn't break

### Continued development

I will work more on React. I've just scratched the surface of it and i hope to learn more in the future!

### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/learn) - The react learn section helps a lot to get into it
